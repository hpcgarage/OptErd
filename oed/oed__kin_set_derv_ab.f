C  OPERATION   : OED__KIN_SET_DERV_AB
C  MODULE      : ONE ELECTRON INTEGRALS DIRECT
C  MODULE-ID   : OED
C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This routine handles the logistics on how to evaluate
C                the (1|2) derivative kinetic integral batch in the
C                most efficient way. It performs the label map:
C
C                               (1|2) --> (A|B)
C
C                and returns some additional data of crucial importance
C                for evaluation of the (A|B) derivative kinetic
C                integrals.
C
C                The freedom we have in making the internal association
C                1,2 -> A,B follows from the 2-fold permutational
C                symmetry of the kinetic integrals in (1|2):
C
C                                 (1|2) = (2|1)
C
C                Note, that this permutational symmetry only holds as
C                long as we permute the differential operators with it.
C
C                Application of the 1 <-> 2 switch is pretty irrelevant
C                here, due to the fact the routine which generates the
C                initial 1D integrals has the possibility to either
C                apply the HRR steps on the A or B shell. Still we
C                choose here to have A>=B for convenience and possibly
C                slightly better performance.
