C  OPERATION   : OED__NAI_1D_CENDERV_INTEGRALS
C  MODULE      : ONE ELECTRON INTEGRALS DIRECT
C  MODULE-ID   : OED
C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This operation performs a single derivation step on
C                a nuclear attraction center C for input 1D nuclear
C                attraction integrals:
C
C            I''(n,a,b,C) =   r * [  a*I'(n,a-1,b,C) + b*I'(n,a,b-1,C) ]
C                         + 2pr * [(P-C)*I'(n,a,b,C) + (1-m)*I(n,a,b,C)]
C
C                and returns the result in a separate array. The
C                explanation of the symbols in the above equation is
C                as follows:
C
C                           m  =  current differentiation order.
C                    I'',I',I  =  m-th,(m-1)-th and (m-2)-th  
C                                 differentiated 1D nuclear
C                                 attraction integral. Note, that
C                                 if m = 1, i.e. when the first order
C                                 differentiated 1D integrals are
C                                 evaluated, the (m-1) term does
C                                 not exist. It only comes into play
C                                 for 2nd and higher derivatives.
C                           r  =  the set of all quadrature roots
C                           p  =  the set of all exponent sums between

C                         P,C  =  gaussian product center coordinate

C                                 
C
C                The derivatives of the 1D integrals are calculated for
C                all roots, all nuclear centers and the present set of
C                exponent pairs.
