C  DESCRIPTION : This operation performs a two-indexed contraction from
C                a block of one electron primitives to contracted
C                integrals:
C
C
C                      sum  [a|b]    -->  (a|b)
C                       ij       ij            rs
C
C                                                r = 1,NCR
C                                                s = 1,NCS
C
C                For optimum performance of the contraction procedure,
C                the contraction routine is written to operate on the
C                batch block of primitive integrals ordered in the
C                following form:
C
C                               pbatch (nxyzt,ij)
C
C                where ij are the partial primitive index pairs being
C                treated here. Their total numbers are MIJ and the
C                individual i,j indices are sitting in PRIMR,PRIMS.
C                If on entry of this routine the primitive integrals
C                are ordered in the form (ij,nxyzt), a transposition
C                has to preceed the actual contraction procedure.
C                This is triggered by the keyword PTRANS, which is
C                set true, if such a transposition is needed. The
C                complete set of cartesian monomial quadruplets is
C                kept together for efficiency through the entire
C                contraction sequence.
C
C                STRATEGY:
C
C                Perform overall contraction in one step:
C
C                  (nxyzt,rs) = (nxyzt,rs)
C                                + ccr (r,i) * ccs (s,j) * (nxyzt,ij)

C                One of the key variables to be determined here
C                is the blocking size of the invariant indices
C                such that the cache is used efficiently. The
C                blocking size has to be adapted also to the size
C                of the working space available. L1USED contains
C                the amount of data that will occupy the cache

C                initial, quarter transformed and halftransformed

C                coefficients, their segmentation limits and the
