C  OPERATION   : OED__OVL_SET_DERV_SEQUENCE
C  MODULE      : ONE ELECTRON INTEGRALS DIRECT
C  MODULE-ID   : OED
C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This routine determines the sequence of centers for
C                the x,y,z-coordinate derivations. The info is stored
C                in arrays CENSQp for each coordinate p=X,Y,Z.
C
C                The indices for the centers obey the following
C                indexing scheme: index 1 -> A and index 2 -> B
C
C                Take the x-coordinate for example and let CENSQX have
C                the following elements on exit from this routine:
C
C                            CENSQX (I) = 2,1,1,2,...
C
C                Then the sequence of single derivations is:
C
C                       dx/dBx  dx/dAx  dx/dAx  dx/dBx  (A|B)
C
C                Note, that the indexing of the CENSQp arrays start
C                with 0. The reason is that the NDERp values might
C                be equal to zero.
C
C                The center sequences are determined such that those
C                on center A come first.
C
C
C                  Input:
C
C                    NDERp        =  the total order of differentiation
C                                    with respect to the p = x,y,z
C                                    coordinates
C                    DERxp        =  the order of differentiation on
C                                    centers x = A and B with respect
C                                    to the p = x,y,z coordinates
C
C                  Output:
C
C                    CENSQp       =  center sequence array for the
C                                    p = x,y,z coordinates
