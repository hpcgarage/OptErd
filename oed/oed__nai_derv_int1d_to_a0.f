C  OPERATION   : OED__NAI_DERV_INT1D_TO_A0
C  MODULE      : ONE ELECTRON INTEGRALS DIRECT
C  MODULE-ID   : OED
C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This routine assembles the set of batches of cartesian
C                derivative nuclear attraction integrals [A|0] or [0|A],
C                adding up the contributions from all the 1D A0 or 0A
C                integrals for all nuclear centers.
C
C                Simplified version of the general AB routine to reduce
C                loop overheads for those cases where there is at least
C                one s-shell. For comments and details see the general
C                AB routine.

C                                   each cartesian component (x = X,Y,Z)

C                                   performed along the x=Y,Z direction
C                    TEMP1(2)    =  scratch arrays holding intermediate

C                    SCALE       =  the NGEXCEN scaling factors

C
C                    BATCH       =  batch of primitive cartesian
