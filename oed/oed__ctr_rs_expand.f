C  OPERATION   : OED__CTR_RS_EXPAND
C  MODULE      : ONE ELECTRON INTEGRALS DIRECT
C  MODULE-ID   : OED
C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This routine expands the rs contraction indices:
C
C                          x (n,r>=s) --> y (n,rs)
C
C
C                  Input:
C
C                      N          =  total # of invariant indices
C                      NRS        =  total # of contraction index pairs
C                                    for contraction shells rs before
C                                    expansion
C                      NR(S)      =  # of contractions for contraction
C                                    shells r(s)
C                      X          =  original integral batch with
C                                    contraction index restriction
C                                    r>=s
C
C                  Output:
C
C                      Y          =  new integral batch with complete
C                                    set of contraction indices rs
