C  OPERATION   : OED__KIN_SET_AB
C  MODULE      : ONE ELECTRON INTEGRALS DIRECT
C  MODULE-ID   : OED
C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This routine handles the logistics on how to evaluate
C                the (1|2) kinetic integral batch in the most efficient
C                way. It performs the label map:
C
C                               (1|2) --> (A|B)
C
C                according to certain criteria that have to be met for
C                efficiency. The freedom we have in making the internal
C                association 1,2 -> A,B follows from the 2-fold
C                permutational symmetry of the kinetic integrals in
C                (1|2):
C
C                                 (1|2) = (2|1)
C
C                If the 1 <-> 2 switch has to be applied is simply
C                governed by the demand that the final A and B shell
C                labels have to obey the relation A>=B, since this means
C                the least amount of space and work needed to generate
C                the necessary 1D overlap and kinetic integrals.
