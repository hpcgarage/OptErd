C  OPERATION   : OED__OVL_DERV_INT1D_TO_A0
C  MODULE      : ONE ELECTRON INTEGRALS DIRECT
C  MODULE-ID   : OED
C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This routine assembles the set of batches of cartesian
C                derivative overlap integrals [A|0] or [0|A].
C
C                Simplified version of the general AB routine to reduce
C                loop overheads for those cases where there is at least
C                one s-shell. For comments and details see the general
C                AB routine.

C                  Input:
C
C                    SHELLA      =  shell types for contraction shell A
C                    NEXP        =  current # of exponent pairs
C                    NXYZA       =  # of cartesian monomials for shell A
C                    INT1Dx      =  all current 1D A0/0A derivative
C                                   nuclear attraction integrals for
C                                   each cartesian component (x = X,Y,Z)
C                    DIFFx       =  is true, if differentiation was
C                                   performed along the x = X,Y,Z
C                                   direction
C                    TEMP1(2)    =  scratch arrays holding intermediate
C                                   1D A0/0A derivative integral
C                                   products
C                    SCALE       =  the NEXP scaling factors
C
C
C                  Output:
C
C                    BATCH       =  batch of primitive cartesian
C                                   [A|0] or [0|A] derivative overlap
C                                   integrals corresponding to all
C                                   current exponent pairs
