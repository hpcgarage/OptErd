C  OPERATION   : OED__XYZ_INIT_OVRLP
C  MODULE      : ONE ELECTRON INTEGRALS DIRECT
C  MODULE-ID   : OED
C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This operation calculates a full table of 1-dimensional
C                overlap integrals of x,y or z type using the Rys
C                vertical recurrence scheme RI explained below.
C
C                The vertical recurrence scheme RI is due to Rys, Dupuis
C                and King, J. Comp. Chem. 4, p.154-157 (1983).
C
C                It's purpose is to generate the first set of integrals
C                used in the recurrence relations for moment integrals
C
C
C                   OVRLAP (0,0) = 1.D0
C                   OVRLAP (1,0) = PA
C
C                   For I = 1,...,SHELLP-1
C                       OVRLAP (I+1,0) = I * (1/2P) * OVRLAP (I-1,0)
C                                              + PA * OVRLAP (I,0)
C
C
C                If SHELLB is > 0, then the horizontal transfer scheme
C                HI is also applied:
C
C                   For J = 1,...,SHELLB
C                   For I = 0,...,SHELLP-J
C                       OVRLAP (I,J) =      OVRLAP (I+1,J-1)
C                                    + AB * OVRLAP (I,J-1)
C
C                If the HI is not needed, the values in ABX,ABY and ABZ
C                have no meaning and can be set as wished.
C
C                The 1D integrals are calculated for all exponent pairs
C                simultaneously and placed into a 3-dimensional array
C                with the exponent pair index varying fastest.
C
C                              !!!IMPORTANT!!!
C
C                In case the 1D integrals are needed for an atom, all
C                even-odd and odd-even shell combinations lead to 1D
C                integrals whose value is zero.
C
C
C                  Input:
C
C                    SHELLx       =  the shell types for shells
C                                    x=P=A+B and x=B
C                    ATOMIC       =  indicates, if purely atomic 1D
C                                    integrals will be evaluated
C                    NEXP         =  # of exponent pairs
C                    PAD          =  current NEXP coordinate D=X,Y,Z
C                                    differences P-A between centers
C                                    P and A
C                    DP           =  current NEXP values of Px, Py, 
C                                    or Pz
C                    PINVHF       =  current NEXP values of 1/(2*P),
C                                    where P are the exponent sums
C                                    for contraction shells A and B
C                    ABM          =  coordinate M=X,Y,Z differences
C                                    A-B between centers A and B
C
C                  Output:
C
C                    OVRLAP       =  1D overlap integrals for one
C                                    cartesian component x = X,Y,Z
