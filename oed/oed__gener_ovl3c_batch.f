C  OPERATION   : OED__GENER_OVL3C_BATCH
C  MODULE      : ONE ELECTRON INTEGRALS DIRECT
C  MODULE-ID   : OED
C  SUBROUTINES : OED__OVL3C_CSGTO
C  DESCRIPTION : Main operation that drives the calculation of a batch
C                of contracted 3-center electron overlap integrals.
C
C
C                  Input (x = 1,2 and 3):
C
C                    IMAX,ZMAX    =  maximum integer + flp memory
C                    NALPHA       =  total # of exponents
C                    NCOEFF       =  total # of contraction coeffs
C                    NCSUM        =  total # of contractions
C                    NCGTOx       =  # of contractions for csh x
C                    NPGTOx       =  # of primitives per contraction
C                                    for csh x
C                    SHELLx       =  the shell type for csh x
C                    Xy,Yy,Zy     =  the x,y,z-coordinates for centers
C                                    y = 1,2 and 3
C                    ALPHA        =  primitive exponents for csh
C                                    1,2 and 3 in that order
C                    CC           =  contraction coefficient for csh
C                                    1,2 and 3 in that order, for each
C                                    csh individually such that an
C                                    (I,J) element corresponds to the
C                                    I-th primitive and J-th contraction.
C                    CC(BEG)END   =  (lowest)highest nonzero primitive
C                                    index for contractions for csh
C                                    1,2 and 3 in that order. They are
C                                    different from (1)NPGTOx only for
C                                    segmented contractions
C                    SPHERIC      =  is true, if spherical integrals
C                                    are wanted, false if cartesian
C                                    ones are wanted
C                    SCREEN       =  is true, if screening will be
C                                    done at primitive integral level
C                    ICORE        =  integer scratch space
C                    ZCORE (part) =  flp scratch space

C                  Output:
C
C                    NBATCH       =  # of integrals in batch
C                    NFIRST       =  first address location inside the
C                                    ZCORE array containing the first
C                                    integral
C                    ZCORE        =  full batch of contracted (123)
C                                    3-center overlap integrals over
C                                    cartesian or spherical gaussians
C                                    starting at ZCORE (NFIRST)
