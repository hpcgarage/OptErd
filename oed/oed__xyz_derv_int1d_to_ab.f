C  MODULE      : ONE ELECTRON INTEGRALS DIRECT

C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This routine assembles the set of batches of cartesian
C                derivative overlap integrals [A|B].
C
C                The routine uses the reduced Rys multiplication scheme
C                as suggested in R.Lindh, U.Ryu and B.Liu, JCP 95, 5889.
C                This scheme reuses intermediate products between
C                1DX and 1DY integrals.

C

C                    NEXP        =  current # of exponent pairs
C                    NXYZx       =  # of cartesian monomials for
C                                   x = A and B shells
C                    INT1Dx      =  all current 1D AB derivative
C                                   nuclear attraction integrals for
C                                   each cartesian component (x = X,Y,Z)
C                    DIFFx       =  is true, if differentiation was
C                                   performed along the x = X,Y,Z
C                                   direction
C                    TEMP1(2)    =  scratch arrays holding intermediate
C                                   1D AB derivative integral products
C                    SCALE       =  the NEXP scaling factors

C
C                    BATCH       =  batch of primitive cartesian [A|B]

C                                   corresponding to all current
C                                   exponent pairs
