C  OPERATION   : OED__OVL3C_F00_DEF_BLOCKS
C  MODULE      : ONE ELECTRON INTEGRALS DIRECT
C  MODULE-ID   : OED
C  SUBROUTINES : none
C  DESCRIPTION : This routine handles the memory partitions for the
C                generation of the entire contracted (f00) 3-center
C                overlap batch. It determines the block size partitions
C                (if any) for the ij exponent pairs of the whole
C                primitive [f00] batch and returns pointers to the
C                flp data sections needed by the (f00) generation.
C                The single k exponent set will be treated as one
C                entity and will not be blocked.
C
C                The routine is also equipped with the possibility
C                of returning just the minimum / optimum flp memory
C                needed, without evaluating the (f00) generation flp
C                pointers. This is useful for establishing just the
C                overall memory size needed for the (f00) generation.
C                The keyword MEMORY has to be set true for this case
C                and obviously the value of ZMAX passed is irrelevant.

C
C             ...determine optimum size of [f00] blocks:
C
C                The next few lines of code are among the most
C                important for performance of the entire 3-center
C                overlap integral package. Any badly chosen sizes
C                for the primitive blocks has a severe effect on the
C                integral evaluation timing. Two opposite effects have
C                to be considered:
C
C                1) Reuse level 1 cache data as much as possible,
C                   i.e. choose the primitive blocks in such a
C                   way that most of the heavy computational work
C                   is being done reusing data in each cache line.
C
C                2) Choose the size of the primitive blocks as
C                   large as possible observing point 1), to reduce
C                   subroutine call overheads as much as possible.
C
C                After some experimenting, the following procedure
C                was found to work best:
C
C                  i) The optimum [f00] block size is assumed to
C                     be directly proportional to the level 1 cache
C                     size.
C
C                 ii) The proportionality factor PFACT has to be
C                     determined by 'experiment', running a real
C                     molecular case with fully contracted basis sets.
C
C
         PFACT = 4

         MIJ = (PFACT * L1CACHE) / (NXYZT * NK)
         MIJ = MAX (1,MIJ)
         MIJ = MIN (MIJ,NIJ)
C
C
C             ...the optimum block size MIJ has been determined.
C                We have to see now how it fits with the rest of
C                the needed data into the maximum memory given.
C                If necessary subdivide the optimum MIJ block size
C                into convenient subblocks that fit into memory.
C
C                The subdivision of the MIJ block is done in such
C                a way that successive powers of 2 are checked as
C                divisors of MIJ. The maximum # of division steps
C                MXSTEP can thus be calculated beforehand by knowing
C                the fact that the smallest subdivided MIJ block
C                is of size 1. The succesive divisors are checked
C                in the following order:
C
C
C                            step  |  div of MIJ
C                           ----------------------
C                              1   |       1
C                              2   |       2
C                              3   |       4
C                              4   |       8
C                              5   |      16
C                             ...         ...
C
C                The routine stops, if even a MIJ block of minimum
C                size 1 cannot be accomodated into the memory.
